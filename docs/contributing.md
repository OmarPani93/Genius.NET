# Contributing to Genius.NET

If you found any bugs in the library then please [create an issue](https://github.com/prajjwaldimri/Genius.NET/issues/new) in the repository.

Create an issue or message me before starting work on new features. This helps reduce conflicts in work (Most of the time devs start working on same problem).

It would be a great help if you can translate these docs in your native language. Visit [this link](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#localization) for more details.

    Thanks for reading! Have a great day :)
