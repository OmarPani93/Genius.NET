# Welcome to Genius.NET

If you have never seen the genius.com [API](https://docs.genius.com), I recommend skimming through the [API](https://docs.genius.com) to get a general idea and familarity with API specific terms.

If you are new to Genius.NET, then please go ahead and start from the [getting started](/getting-started) guide, which walks through configuring the basics.

If you are looking for real world examples, check out [ExampleApplication](https://github.com/prajjwaldimri/Genius.NET/tree/master/ExampleApplication)

To translate these docs, please create a pull-request on the repository.
